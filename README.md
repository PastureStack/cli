# PastureStack CLI

CLI manages compatible environments, hosts, stacks, services, containers, volumes, secrets, catalogs, and accounts through the preserved API.

PastureStack is an independent community effort to preserve, audit, and modernize the Rancher 1.6 ecosystem. It is not affiliated with or endorsed by Rancher Labs or SUSE.

**Upstream:** [`rancher/cli`](https://github.com/rancher/cli). This GitHub fork preserves upstream history, authorship, dates, tags, licenses, and bundled dependency notices. PastureStack maintenance is consolidated into one commit after the preserved upstream boundary.

## Project status

This is a migration proof of concept based on the latest reviewed upstream `v1.6` branch. Existing Ubuntu 26.04, Go 1.26.4, modern Docker, non-root packaging, dependency, shell, and test maintenance is retained. The maintained binary and image name is `pasturestack`.

No CI/CD, binary publication, image publication, release, deployment, or production-readiness claim is enabled.

## Configuration

Use `PASTURESTACK_URL`, `PASTURESTACK_ACCESS_KEY`, and `PASTURESTACK_SECRET_KEY`. Generic `PLATFORM_*` names, historical environment-variable names, and the existing on-disk configuration are read as migration aliases so established installations and scripts continue to work. Set `PASTURESTACK_LOCALE=en-US` or `zh-TW` for operator messages.

## Build and test

```sh
make build
make test
make package
```

Packaging is local only and does not publish an image. See [COMPATIBILITY.md](COMPATIBILITY.md), [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md), and [ORIGIN.md](ORIGIN.md).
